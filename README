Our script:
We demonstrate the linking worked by going to the first occurence of puts,
and checking to see if the linking code is called after, or if puts is called.
In our case we go to this code, and the first jump statement, jumps to
the libc code for puts. Therefore we know that our manual linking was sucessful.

Line 27 is the first occurence of puts.
We want to go there and check if the linker is called.

If we after this instruction we are still in the plt, the linker was called.
If we are in puts, we know that our linking was successful.
